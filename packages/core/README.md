## So, why create another walkthrough library?

Well alot of the other walkthrough library didn't allow me use a custom tooltip element, i also had a need for the walkthrough step state to change on different screen size for each step "Steps with media query", i was able to achieve this with some tricks on those libabry but i believe this should come natively.

Lastly the transition experience between ajala steps is just alot more smoother.
